## Django Polls Application
(description.)
A tutorial project made using Python(3.7) with Django(2.2) framework.
In this case i made polls app.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 or newer
* Django 2.1.2 or newer
* Python add-on modules as in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Running
* make sure you meet all requirement.
* then type this ``` python3 manage.py runserver```

i'm not sure how "Replace the (stupid) example question “What’s up?” with 2 poll questions of your own choice. Ask some friends to take your polls." and "Be sure to ignore the database (db.sqlite3), Python compiler output, and IDE project files."
are working together.

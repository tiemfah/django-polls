# About this project
A tutorial project made using python with Django framework.
In this case i was made polls app.

i'm not sure how "Replace the (stupid) example question “What’s up?” with 2 poll questions of your own choice. Ask some friends to take your polls." and "Be sure to ignore the database (db.sqlite3), Python compiler output, and IDE project files."
are working together.
